# Student Performance Prediction using Multiple Linear Regression

## Problem Statement

**Objective**: To develop a regression model that accurately predicts the Student Performance Index using multiple independent variables.

**Features**: Hours Studied, Previous Scores, Sleep Hours, Number of practice papers practiced, Extracurricular Activities.

**Model Development**: Employed Multiple Variable Linear Regression model to establish a predictive model. The model will learn the relationship between these input features and the student's performance metric.

**Conclusion**: The Multiple Linear Regression model built for predicting the Student Performance Index demonstrates excellent predictive capability. Based on the evaluation metrics obtained from the test dataset:

- R² Score: 0.9889
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 1.61
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): 4.08
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 2.02
